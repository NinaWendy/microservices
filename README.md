# REST API & Graphql

Here we create a Products's list using a Flask server. The application allows you to add a product, retrieve the products, retrieve a specific product with its id, update a specific product with its id, and delete a product with its id. All these operations will be achieved through the REST API endpoints in the Flask server.

The application has API endpoints to perform Create, Retrieve, Update, and Delete operations on the above data using a Flask server.

cURL and POSTMAN is used to test the implemented endpoints.
